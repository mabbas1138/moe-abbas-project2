REVIEW

> *** DOUBLE CHECK THAT ALL CLASSES ARE BEING USED...IF NOT, DELETE NAME ***

> Double check for Inception rule

> Look at first project to see use of margin, padding, max-width

> Change flex-master global as mixin and update html accordingly

> See if you need a percentage on the padding...Do you want it to scale up/down? If not, use pixels.

> **SEE IF YOU CAN USE TEXT ALIGN:CENTER/ETC. INSTEAD OF PADDING**

> **Change line height on reduced font sizes**


=======

** Check to see if images are optimized (https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/blob/master/css/image-formats-and-svg.md)
-- Consider using https://tinypng.com/
-- **Try not going over 400kb, unless it's a massive background image**

** If your site is loading slowly, it could be because of the image sizes **
